# Demo

This directory contains some demos that provide resolution for classic problems about probability and statistics.

To run these demos, you need to:

1. Clone this git repository to your local directory
2. Install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm i`

And then you can use the npm script `run-demo` to run these demos, likes this:

```bash
yarn run-demo ./demo/train/solution1.js # OR npm run run-demo ./demo/train/solution1.js
```

Anyway, you can create an issue if necessary, please.
